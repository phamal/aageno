STEP 1
Vacuum the entire area you plan to clean.

STEP 2
In "RINSE" mode go over the entire are you plan to clean.
This step makes the carpet damp. The cleaning solution works much better with a damp carpet.

STEP 3
In "WASH" mode work over one area of the room at a time.

STEP 4
Switch the nob to "RINSE" mode and go over the same area again.
- This activates the carpet solution to work further to remove stains and odors.
- It also sucks up the remaining carpet solution that was initially left behind.

STEP 5
- Allow the carpet to air dry / use a fan / open the windows.
- Vacuum the carpet after it is fully dry to pick up any loose dirt / loose carpet fibers.
