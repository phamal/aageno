####### Data export spike ########## 
1. Agency ids needs to be provided. 
2. Only filter is the date range. 
3. Data are not real time. Aggregation refreshes in a certain intervals. 
4. Example of a materialized view. 
	CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW DW.BID_VIEWED_SUPPLIER_MV 
	TABLESPACE DWDATA
	REFRESH FORCE
	START WITH SYSDATE
	NEXT NEXT_DAY(TRUNC(SYSDATE),'SUNDAY')+8/24
	WITH PRIMARY KEY
	AS 
	SELECT DISTINCT dan.auctionid, OO.NAME VIEWED_SUPPLIER
	  FROM DPX.DPX_AUCTION_NEW dan,
	       DPX.dpx_org_access_entity doae,
	       DPX.org_org oo
	 WHERE     dan.current_head_roundid = doae.entity_id
	       AND doae.entity_type = 'DPXROUND'
	       AND doae.oid = oo.oid;
5. I would recommend a combination of materalized view and existing realtime reporting tool to achieve the needs of Business Intelligence for links plus.
